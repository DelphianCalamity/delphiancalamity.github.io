I am a Research Scientist at Meta, where I work on Meta’s internal container deployment and cluster management system — the core infrastructure that powers Meta at scale.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Columbia University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.asafcidon.com/" target="_blank">Asaf Cidon</a> and <a href="https://roxanageambasu.github.io/" target="_blank">Roxana Geambasu</a>.
My research spanned broad areas of computer systems, including distributed systems, privacy, and systems for machine learning. 
The bulk of my Ph.D. work centered on building functional system prototypes to enhance the practicality of differentially private databases.

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Athens, where I specialized in software systems, big data, and machine learning.

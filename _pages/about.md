I am a PhD candidate at the Computer Science department of Columbia University, working with <a href="https://www.asafcidon.com/" target="_blank">Asaf Cidon</a> and <a href="https://roxanageambasu.github.io/" target="_blank">Roxana Geambasu</a>.

My research spans broad areas of computer systems including distributed systems, privacy and systems for machine learning with a focus on optimizing training for large-scale deep neural networks. 
Lately, my work focuses on building functional prototypes of practical data systems that can leverage differential privacy to provide privacy guarantees to their users.

I studied Computer Science at the University of Athens with a specialization in software systems, big data and machine learning.

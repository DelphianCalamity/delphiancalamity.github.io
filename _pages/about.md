I am PhD student at the Computer Science department of Columbia University, co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.asafcidon.com/" target="_blank">Asaf Cidon</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/" target="_blank">Junfeng Yang</a>.
My current research focuses on the intersection of systems and differential privacy.

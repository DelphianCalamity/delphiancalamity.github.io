Cookie Monster is an on-device budgeting component that can be integrated into differentially private ad measurement systems. Powered by a robust theoretical framework known as Individual Differential Privacy (IDP), a variant of traditional differential privacy, Cookie Monster allows advertisers to conserve significantly
more privacy budget compared to existing alternatives. 
Cookie Monster is incorporated in Mozilla's W3C draft for standardization -- now under active specification with participation from all major browsers.

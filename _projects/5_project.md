Effective caching for linear query workloads over DP databases. Turbo builds upon private multiplicative weights (PMW), a DP mechanism that is powerful in theory but very ineffective in practice, 
and transforms it into a highly effective caching object, namely PMW-Bypass. A description of this project can be found on our paper, titled Turbo: Effective caching in Differentially-Private Databases.
